# LLM-RAG-based-function-execution

In developing the FastAPI Function Execution API, we employed a structured methodology to create a robust, efficient, and user-friendly system. The following outlines the theoretical framework and processes undertaken:​

Framework Selection:

FastAPI: Chosen for its high performance, ease of use, and automatic generation of interactive API documentation. FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities and support for Python type hints made it an ideal choice for this project. ​

Function Definition and Registration:

Predefined Functions: We developed a set of functions (e.g., open_chrome, open_calculator, open_notepad) designed to perform specific tasks.​

Function Registry: A dictionary was implemented to map descriptive keywords to their corresponding function references and names, facilitating efficient retrieval based on user input.​

User Input Processing and Function Retrieval:

Input Analysis: User prompts are analyzed using keyword matching techniques to identify the most relevant function.​

Retrieval Mechanism: By comparing user input against registered keywords, the system determines the best-matching function to execute.​

Dynamic Code Generation:

Code Synthesis: Upon identifying the appropriate function, the system dynamically generates Python code to invoke the function. This code includes necessary imports and error handling to ensure robustness.​

Session Management:

Interaction Logging: A session history is maintained, recording details such as timestamps, user queries, retrieved functions, and generated code snippets. This facilitates tracking and auditing of interactions.​

API Endpoint Implementation:

Endpoint Design: A /execute endpoint was created to handle POST requests containing user prompts.​

Request Handling: The endpoint processes incoming requests by retrieving the appropriate function, generating the corresponding code, executing it, and returning the outcome to the user.​

Testing and Validation:

Automated Testing: We developed test functions to simulate API requests and validate responses, ensuring that the system behaves as expected under various scenarios.​

Session Verification: The session history is reviewed to confirm accurate logging of interactions and proper function execution.​

Deployment Considerations:

Production Readiness: Configurations were adjusted for production environments, including setting appropriate debug modes and optimizing performance settings. ​

Security Measures: Implemented best practices for securing the API, such as input validation and error handling, to protect against common vulnerabilities. ​
